AIM: Implement Arduino Uno Based Oscilloscope.

Components: Arduino Uno board, Potentiometer, Breadboard, Jumper Wires

Theory: An oscilloscope is an electronic measuring instrument used to observe and
analyze electrical signals. It displays a graph of voltage (Y-axis) versus time (X-axis),
allowing users to see how signals change over time.
Oscilloscopes are essential for:
● Measuring signal amplitude and frequency
● Observing waveform shapes (sine, square, triangular)
● Detecting noise or unexpected variations
● Debugging electronic circuits

code


void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);  //Starts serial communication at 9600 baud, so the
                       //Arduino can send data to your computer (Serial Monitor).
}

void loop() {
  int value = analogRead(A0);  //Reads the voltage on analog pin A0
  
  Serial.println(value);       //Sends the reading to the Serial Monitor so you can
                               //see the value
  
  delay(10);                   //Waits 10 milliseconds, so you get about 100 readings per
                               //second.
