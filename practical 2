Aim: Displaying different LED patterns with Arduino.

Components: Arduino Uno Board,Breadboard,LEDs, Resistors (220 ohm) ,Jumper Wires.

Theory: LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric
current passes through it. Unlike regular bulbs, LEDs are energy-efficient and produce little
heat.In Arduino projects, LEDs are commonly used to:
● Indicate status (on/off)
● Display patterns
● Provide visual feedback
An LED has two legs:
● Anode (+) – longer leg, connected to positive voltage (Arduino pin)
● Cathode (–) – shorter leg, connected to ground
A current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220 ohms) is always used in series to protect the LED from
excessive current.

void setup()
{
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
    digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
    digitalWrite(12, LOW);
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
    digitalWrite(11, HIGH);
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
    digitalWrite(11, LOW);
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
